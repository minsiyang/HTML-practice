      <p>Programming has always been women's work.</p>

      <p>
        The discipline was founded by a woman, after all. When humanity took its first halting steps 
        into the Information Age, it needed a feminine touch. While recent revisionist efforts by 
        masculists have emphasized the work of Charles Babbage, the reality is that he supplied only 
        brute manipulation of matter with his mechanical device. And it didn't even work! Babbage's 
        failures set the information age back by a century. It was Ada Lovelace who supplied the code.

        When the Information Age finally dawned, it was (inevitably) thanks to women's industry. 
        The transition from textiles to text files began with punch cards and Marie Joseph's Jacquard 
        loom. Those same punch cards echo through history to the traditional 80 character line limit today. 
        Weaving is deeply embedded in code, and the fine motor skills needed to work thread have simply 
        never been a masculine trait. The ancient Romans understood this; it is the goddess Minerva who 
        watches over both weaving and philosophy.

        Women, not men, wove the core memory that landed men on the moon. This is not to diminish the 
        clumsy heroism of the boys who risked their lives on the journey itself. They too had their 
        contribution to make to history. But they were simply passengers, and the real triumph was getting 
        them there at all.
